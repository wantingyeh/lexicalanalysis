# Lexical Analysis
The scripts in this repository contain the scripts that Wan-Ting creates for her PhD thesis and future publication.


## FrequencyTable.ipnb
This script counts the frequency of the lexical words in one csv file.

## UniqueWordSpacy.ipnb
This script contains two steps
1. cleaning the text: including tokenisation, lemmentisation and manual identify the words to be replaced or removed
2. unique word: output the distinct words in the text and count the numbers of the distinct word
This script is based on the SpaCy module.

## Ch3_randomsampling_Heaps & CH3_randomspaling-loop_Zipf
These two scripts create a simulated environment to control the sample size of each corpus with two lexical analysis approaches: Zipf or Heaps' law.
